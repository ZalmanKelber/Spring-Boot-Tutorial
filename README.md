This is a repository to keep track of the simple projects for this very basic [introduction to SpringBoot](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-getting-started) course.

To run these projects, make sure java 1.8 is installed as the default and, if using a mac, download sdkman to install groovy, and springboot.
